The following project (translated to: Machine learning applied to blackjack) was elaborated in the framework of TDR (research project) at IES Alc√∫dia. It consists of a 30-page report on sociocultural and historical aspects of the studied game, as well as an explanation of the hypothesis and validation approach. In addition, I have included a presentation on the project in slides, which I displayed to a panel of expert judges. Finally, there is a document with the code used to validate the initial hypothesis and the corresponding explanation.
