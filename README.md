The following project, titled "Machine Learning Applied to Blackjack," was developed as part of the TDR (Research Project) at IES Alc√∫dia. It includes a 30-page report on the sociocultural and historical aspects of the game, as well as a detailed explanation of the hypothesis and the validation approach. Additionally, I have included a slide presentation on the project. Lastly, there is a document containing the code used to validate the initial hypothesis, accompanied by an explanation.
